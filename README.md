# Productivity Flow

**All‑in‑one web productivity suite to help you plan, track, and focus.**

## 🚀 What is Productivity Flow  

Productivity Flow is a browser‑based productivity tool that unifies essential time‑management and organization utilities — such as a Pomodoro timer, task manager, calendar, note-taking (Markdown & sticky notes), mind‑map editor, code/text snippet manager, and more — into a single, distraction-free workspace.  

It’s built to help you break free from app overload and stay focused: manage daily tasks, track working time, jot down ideas or notes, organize code snippets or text patterns (regex), and visualize long-term plans — all in one place.

## ✅ Key Features  

- **Pomodoro Timer** — plan focused work sessions and breaks to boost concentration.  
- **Task Manager / To‑Do List** — create, edit, and manage daily or long‑term tasks.

- **Calendar & Time‑Zone Support** — plan tasks, events or deadlines across date/time zones.

- **Code/Text Snippet Organizer & Regex/JSON Tools** — useful for developers or anyone dealing with code or structured data.
